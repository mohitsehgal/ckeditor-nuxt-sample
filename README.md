# ckeditor-nuxt-sample

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how you integrate CkEditor with Nuxt.js project. The WYSWYG editor is refactored into `components/rich-editor.vue` which can be easily re-used in your project. Don't forget to include the dependencies.


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
